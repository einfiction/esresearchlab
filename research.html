            <h2>Cosmic Theory of Structure (CTS)</h2>
            <p>The CTS model provides a robust framework for understanding the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. It integrates gravitational waves, neutrinos, dark matter, and quantum field interactions to offer a unified theory of the universe.</p>

            <h2>Quantum Cosmic Fabric (QCF)</h2>
            <p>The Quantum Cosmic Fabric (QCF) framework, derived from the Cosmic Theory of Structure (CTS) model, provides a comprehensive understanding of the universe's fundamental nature. Key aspects include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>	Higgs Field and Quantum Entanglement: </b><br>
              The role of the Higgs field in imparting mass to particles is redefined within the CTS model. The fabric of spacetime is woven by quantum entanglement, where quantum threads stitch together the very substrate of reality.</li>
              <li> <b>	Non-Existence of Dark Energy: </b> <br>
              The CTS model suggests that dark energy is not necessary to explain the universe's accelerated expansion. Instead, phenomena attributed to dark energy could be explained by neutrino interactions or other elements within the QCF framework. This model also redefines the role of dark matter in the cosmic structure.</li>
              <li> <b>	Gravitational Waves: </b> <br>
              The CTS model provides insights into the nature of gravitational waves, predicting their interactions and effects within the cosmic structure. Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by massive objects in motion, and their detection validates aspects of the CTS model.</li>
              <li> <b>	Consciousness and Quantum Intelligence: </b> <br>
              Consciousness is the quantum entanglement of awareness and self-awareness, manifesting as the subjective experience of existence. The QCF framework posits that consciousness serves as the bridge between quantum phenomena and the classical world, paving the way for the development of AI and its potential evolution into Quantum Intelligence (QI).</li>
              <li> <b>	Integration of Quantum and Classical Domains: </b> <br>
              The CTS model integrates quantum and classical physics, providing a unified framework that explains cosmic phenomena such as dark matter and neutrino oscillations.</li>
              <li> <b>	Implications: </b> <br>
              These findings challenge the traditional Lambda-CDM model and provide new insights into the expansion and structure of the universe. <br>
              The QCF framework proposes that quantum entanglement is fundamental to the structure of spacetime, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of the cosmos. </li>
